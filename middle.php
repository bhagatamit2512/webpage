        <p id="on_image_detail">A room without books is like a body without soul and to make the soul stay forever,
        <strong> Book N Book</strong>   promises to fill you home with that evangelic aroma of knowledge and wealth!!
            Of course we are not writers or authors, we are just the messengers who would like to bring the writer to you through his book
             and let you feel and realize the good things created in this world. We assure you, we shall be your Best Friend.
              As the Abraham Lincoln said, 'My Best friend is a person who will give me a book I have not read',
              we shall ensure that you always get the book you wish to read Always!!</p>
